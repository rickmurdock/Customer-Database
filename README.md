## Description

Let's say what we want to build an internal database of our customers so we can easily see who they all are. Since we've not started working with our own local databases yet, we will instead use an open API called Random User. This is where we will pull all of our data from.

First, head on over to the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) to get an understanding of how their API works. Once you understand that, use the mockup below to create that page.

Also, make sure to only pull in 12 users for this project.
